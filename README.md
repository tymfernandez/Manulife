This project is a web-based system built specifically for the Aquila Celestials region of Manulife Philippines. Its goal is to modernize and streamline the recruitment process and client lead management for Financial Advisors, Unit Heads, and Branch Leaders.

The platform replaces the manual use of Google Forms and Sheets with a centralized, user-friendly solution. It features a multi-role access system, a public-facing application form with referral tracking, and an internal dashboard for managing applicants and prospects.


Core features include:
- Role-based access for admins, region heads, branches, units, and FAs
- Anonymous application form with referral name tracking
- Real-time data storage via Supabase with CRUD capabilities
- Simple UI for tracking recruitment and client inquiries
